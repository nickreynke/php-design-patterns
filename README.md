## Testing

For demonstration purposes I've set up tests which you can execute the design patterns
to see if they work properly, what they output and how you could use them.

To run the tests you need to install dependencies via [Composer](https://getcomposer.org)
by executing `composer install` in your console.

Finally run the tests by executing `php vendor/bin/phpunit` in your console.

The tests are located in the `tests` directory.
