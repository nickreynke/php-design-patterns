# PHP Design Patterns

Design patterns, in PHP 7, learnt (**not** copied) from the eBook "[Design Patterns Explained Simply](https://sourcemaking.com/design-patterns-ebook)" by Alexander Shvets.

> This repository is currently in its development phase so don't wonder if there aren't any patterns or there are some patterns missing.

## Testing

> Not fully implemented yet!

For demonstration purposes I've set up tests which you can execute the design patterns
to see if they work properly and to see what they output.

To run the tests you need to install dependencies via [Composer](https://getcomposer.org)
by executing `composer install` in your console.

Finally run the tests by executing `php vendor/bin/phpunit` in your console.
