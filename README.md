# PHP Design Patterns

Design patterns, in PHP 7, learnt (**not** copied) from the eBook "[Design Patterns Explained Simply](https://sourcemaking.com/design-patterns-ebook)" by Alexander Shvets.

> This repository is currently in its development phase so don't wonder if there aren't any patterns or there are some patterns missing.

## Run a design pattern

> Future feature. Not fully implemented yet!

For demonstration purposes I've set up a console command with which you can execute
a desired design pattern to see what it does and outputs.

To run the console command you need to install dependencies via [Composer](https://getcomposer.org)
by executing `composer install` in your console.

Finally run the console command with `php bin/console run:design-pattern`. The correct usage
can be displayed with `php bin/console run:design-pattern --help`.
